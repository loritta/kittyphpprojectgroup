    <h1>What is breeding? </h1>
    <p>Animal breeding is the process of selective mating of animals 
        with desirable genetic traits, to maintain or enhance these 
        traits in future generations.

        <h1> How did it start? </h1>
        <p> It started with the purchase of a cat(Scottish fold) that was shipped by air from 
            
            Moscow, Russian Federation. 
            After a year we decided to keep him company with a lovely Scottish straight mate.
            
            They had offspring in few months after.
            
            Friends of ours being in love with the breed also got Scottish babies and now we are 
            collaborating on 
            spreading the love for the breed all over Canada.
